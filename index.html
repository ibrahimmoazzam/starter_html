        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes
          and a small, black cute nose. Rocket is named rocket because he runs
          so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest. Rocket
          loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping
          towards my bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at
          first, but will ‘say hi’ to you after a few seconds. He is also
          friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size
          dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don’t hesitate
          to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.

        <p>
          With a coat as dark as midnight but eyes as bright as stars, he seemed
          to embody both the mystery and the exuberance of life itself. Agile
          and playful, he danced around the park as if the grass were his
          personal stage, captivating everyone with his vivacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, when at home, Chako transformed into a zen master. He would curl
          up on his favorite rug, eyes half-closed in contemplation, as if
          solving the great puzzles of the universe. Both spirited and serene,
          Mochi was a living testament to the richness of dualities, teaching
          his human companions that one could be many things all at once.
