      <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
      <p>
        Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers
        over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife
        and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half
        the world's active geysers.
      </p>
      <p>
        These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among
        the tourists. Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by
        getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
        bad decisions by visiting
